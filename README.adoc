== mmm-demo-ui

The module `mmm-demo-ui` provides a showcase demonstrating the vision and features of `mmm-ui` and its underlying dependencies (e.g. `mmm-bean`).
To make it short, have a look at link:shared/src/main/java/io/github/mmm/demo/ui/shared/DemoUi.java[DemoUi] that shows a simple user-interface example that is fully portable.
Via link:fx/src/main/java/io/github/mmm/demo/ui/fx/DemoUiFx.java[DemoUiFx] you can run this demo as JavaFx desktop application.
In the same way, link:tvm/src/main/java/io/github/mmm/demo/ui/tvm/DemoUiTvm.java[DemoUiTvm] makes the same demo run in any modern browser.
